<h2><i class="fas fa-cloud" style="font-size:120%;color:rgb(165,215,255);"></i>Graph Analysis</h2>
<p class = "normal">There are 2 different types of dataset which are discrete, continuous. There are three combinations of discrete and continuous data. </p>
<ul class = "p">
  <li>Discrete to Discrete - Pie Chart</li>
  <li>Continuous to discrete - Bar Chart</li>
  <li>Continuous to continuous - Scatter Graph</li>
  </ul>

<h2><i class="fas fa-cloud" style="font-size:120%;color:rgb(165,215,255);"></i>Feature Importance Analysis</h2>
<p class = "normal"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to find the relationship between features and target precisely, we devided all features into two groups - discrete and continuous.</p>
  <ul class = "p">
<li>Measurement of relationship between discrete features and the target are cummulative emtropy, since monotonic distribution (low entropy) represent more relavent between the given features and target.
while equilibrium distribution (high entropy) represent less relevent between the given features and the target.</li>
<li>Measurement of relationship between continuous features and the target are based on logistic regression which can map the range of continuous data into (0,1).
And then using model accuracy to find the correlation between features and target.</li>
</ul>

<h2><i class="fas fa-cloud" style="font-size:120%;color:rgb(165,215,255);"></i>Model</h2>
<p class = "normal"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We present two models, simple logistic model and more complicated stacked model.</p>
<ul class = "p">
<li>Logistic model derive from logistic regression with linear model before feed into sigmoid function whose penalty nomalization is L2</li>
<li>Stacked model feed original dataset to three different models, output 3 advanced features then use logistic regression same as above to learn from these three features. First in-stack is a SVM classifier with linear kernal and relatively low coefficients.
  Second model is a decision tree. Third model is a gradient boosting model with 500 estimators and each estimator is stump with depth equals three. suffered from insufficient data sample, complicated stack model is a little bit overfitting.</li>
</ul>

<h2><i class="fas fa-cloud" style="font-size:120%;color:rgb(165,215,255);"></i>Clustering</h2>
<p class = "normal"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To discover potential relationships among features, we present two kinds of clustering methods regarding PCA compressed data.</p>
<ul class = "p">
<li>Kmeans - clustering based on centers.</li>
<li>Spectral - clustering regarding distance among neighbours.</li>
</ul>
